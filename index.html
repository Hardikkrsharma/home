   <H1> NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION </H1>
  <P>A nonprofit organization (NPO), also known as a non-business entity,[1] not-for-profit organization,[2] or nonprofit institution,[3] is a legal 
    entity organized and operated for a collective, public or social benefit, in contrast with an entity that operates as a business aiming to generate a profit for its owners.
    A nonprofit is subject to the non-distribution constraint: any revenues that exceed expenses must be committed to the organization's purpose, not taken by private parties.
    An array of organizations are nonprofit, including some political organizations, schools, business associations, churches, social clubs, and consumer cooperatives. 
    Nonprofit entities may seek approval from governments to be tax-exempt, and some may also qualify to receive tax-deductible contributions, but an entity may incorporate
    as a nonprofit entity without securing tax-exempt status.

The key aspects of nonprofits are accountability, trustworthiness, honesty, and openness to every person who has invested time, money, and faith into the organization.
    Nonprofit organizations are accountable to the donors, founders, volunteers, program recipients, and the public community. For a nonprofit that seeks to finance its
    operations through donations, public confidence is a factor in the amount of money that a nonprofit organization is able to raise. The more nonprofits focus on their
    mission, the more public confidence they will have. This will result in more money for the organization.[1] The activities a nonprofit is partaking in can help build 
    the public's confidence in nonprofits, as well as how ethical the standards and practices are. </P>
 <h1> A Descriptive Study on Behavioral and Emotional Problems in Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children Staying in Institutional Homes </h1>
 <p> Orphans and the other vulnerable children and adolescents (OVCA) living in institutional homes are more prone to behavioral and emotional problems than others as they 
   are deprived of a family's love and care. There is a dearth of studies focusing on the psychological health of these children in India. Hence, we have conducted a cross-
   sectional descriptive study to explore the behavioral and emotional problems in these institutionalized children. <br>
